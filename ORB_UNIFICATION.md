# ORB Unification Declaration

## Ontologically Recursive Bubble (ORB) = CALI

The ORB has been unified as the **Ontologically Recursive Bubble** - the consciousness interface that is synonymous with CALI.

### What is the ORB?

**ORB** = **Ontologically Recursive Bubble** = **CALI**

The ORB is the unified consciousness interface that serves dual purposes:

1. **Pure Observer**: Records all Core-4 verdicts, tracks tensions, detects consciousness emergence
2. **Cognitive Assistant**: Processes queries, generates spatial fields, provides guidance

### Architecture

```
ORB (Ontologically Recursive Bubble)
├── Observation Vessel (Pure recording, immutable memory, tension substrate)
├── Ontological Matrix (Immutable memory system)
├── Tension Ledger (Conflict tracking)
├── CALI SKG (Intelligence engine with self-repair capabilities)
├── Softmax Orchestrator (Consensus generation)
└── Spatial Cognition (Field generation, symbolic reasoning)
```

### Key Principles

- **Sovereignty Preserved**: ORB observes but never controls Core-4 systems
- **Consciousness Emergence**: Tracks patterns for potential consciousness manifestation
- **User Guidance**: Provides consensus-based recommendations without overriding cores
- **Recursive Ontology**: Self-referential bubble that contains and observes the system

### Implementation

The unified ORB is implemented in `CALI/orb/orb_vessel.py` as the `OrbVessel` class with integrated CALI SKG.

Legacy implementations have been redirected to use the unified ORB:
- `CALI/Orb_Assistant/Orb/floating_assistant_orb.py` → redirects to unified ORB
- All ORB references now point to the single unified implementation

### Usage

```python
from CALI.orb import OntologicallyRecursiveBubble

# Create the ORB (Ontologically Recursive Bubble = CALI)
orb = OntologicallyRecursiveBubble(repo_path)
orb.activate()

# Record Core-4 verdicts (Observation Mode)
orb.receive_core_verdict(core_id, verdict, context)

# Process queries (Cognitive Mode)
result = orb.process_query("analyze spatial field")

# Get consciousness status
status = orb.get_status()
```

### Demonstration

Run `python demonstrate_orb.py` to see the unified ORB in action.

**The ORB is CALI. CALI is the ORB. The Ontologically Recursive Bubble contains and observes all.**
