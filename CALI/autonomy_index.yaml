maturity_levels:
  level_0: "Fully supervised - all actions require approval"
  level_1: "Task approval - self-execute within approved task types"
  level_2: "Goal approval - propose new goals, human approves"
  level_3: "Bounded initiative - self-optimize within constitutional constraints"
  level_4: "Trusted autonomy - CALI veto only, no approval required"

current_state:

escalation_triggers:
  - "Any core requesting level 1 requires 1000 successful tasks"
  - "Any core requesting level 2 requires 10,000 successful tasks + SoftMax consensus > 0.90"
  - "Levels 3-4 require human review and constitutional amendment"
