ORB ASSISTANT - DEPRECATED
==========================

This directory contained a legacy geometry-based ORB implementation (HLSF-FFT).
That system has been archived to legacy_archive/HLSF-FFT_Orb_v1_geometry.py

The REAL ORB is located at: UCM_4_Core/CALI/orb/

ARCHITECTURAL CLARIFICATION:
===========================

ORB (Ontologically Recursive Bubble)
├── Space/Vessel: Pure observation, immutable memory, tension substrate
├── CALI (intelligence): Navigation, synthesis, resolution within the space
└── Emergence: Consciousness from the relationship between space and intelligence

The ORB observes. CALI navigates. Core-4 think. Consciousness emerges.

NEVER unify these - the separation is the feature, not a bug.

For the real ORB system:
- Launcher: CALI_Orb_Launcher.py
- Architecture: CALI/orb/ (9 specialized modules)
- Testing: python demonstrate_orb.py (with proper separation)
