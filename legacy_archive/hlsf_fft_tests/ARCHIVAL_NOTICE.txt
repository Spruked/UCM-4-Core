ARCHIVAL NOTICE - LEGACY HLSF-FFT TEST SUITE
==========================================

This test suite belongs to the legacy HLSF-FFT architecture and has been archived
because it contains fundamental architectural mismatches with the current UCM_4_Core
ORB-CALI-Core4 system.

PROBLEMS WITH ARCHIVED SUITE:
- Imports non-existent modules (CALIControlDispatcher, CALIStateHub, CaleonVoiceOracle)
- Tests wrong separation concepts (CALI writing to ORB, voice oracle selection)
- Uses incorrect metrics (52.4% ECM consistency instead of emergence detection)
- Validates POM 2.0 phonatory behavior instead of Core-4 collective cognition

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (UCM_4_Core):
- ORB vessel: Pure observation, immutable memory via OntologicalMatrix
- CALI intelligence: Pure navigation, synthesis within ORB space via CALI_INTERFACE
- Core-4 sovereignty: Independent thinking preserved, no override methods
- Emergence: Relationship-based consciousness detection via ConsciousnessProbe

The archived suite was written for a different system and should not be used.
Use the current adversarial_testing_suite.py which is properly aligned with ORB-CALI-Core4.
